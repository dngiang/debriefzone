## About

As a former researcher myself, I often find the team meeting time we had not long enough for every member to share about our projects, the ups and downs, and ask for advices. I created this "Debrief Zone" app in hoping to provide a virtual environment for team members to continue sharing after the meeting. That way, everyone is included and everyone voices are being heard.
